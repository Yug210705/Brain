                            Why do Healthcare Organizations need a CIO Operating Model?

                            <p>
                                In most health plan organizations, IT operates as a "black box." CEOs and board members know money is going in, but they can't see what's coming out. Projects seem perpetually delayed. Costs are difficult to justify. Security posture is unclear. And when something breaks, the organization discovers systemic issues that have been building for years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The root cause isn't usually technical — it's structural. Without a formal <strong className="text-white">CIO operating model for healthcare</strong>, there is no standardized framework for IT governance, performance measurement, risk management, or strategic alignment. IT leaders are left to improvise, and healthcare executives are left without the visibility they need to make informed decisions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The CIO Operating System™ was developed by <Link to="/about" className="text-[#348DF0] hover:underline">Brian Damiani</Link> after 25+ years of leading IT organizations inside healthcare payers. It codifies the governance structures, reporting mechanisms, and operational disciplines that effective healthcare CIOs use to run IT as a true business function — and makes them repeatable, measurable, and sustainable.

                            Implementation begins with our <Link to="/ITservices" className="text-[#348DF0] hover:underline font-semibold">IT health check for health plans</Link> (CIO360), which establishes a comprehensive baseline of your current IT maturity across all six diagnostic dimensions. This assessment identifies the gaps, risks, and priorities that the operating model addresses.

                            From there, the CIO Operating System™ is deployed incrementally — starting with the highest-priority areas identified in the diagnostic. For most health plans, this means establishing visibility and reporting first, followed by security governance, operational standardization, and strategic alignment frameworks.

                        <p>
                            The operating model is designed to work whether you have an internal CIO or are utilizing our <Link to="/healthcare" className="text-[#348DF0] hover:underline font-semibold">CIO as a service for health plans</Link> model. It creates the structural foundation that any healthcare CIO — current or future — needs to run IT effectively as a governed business function.
