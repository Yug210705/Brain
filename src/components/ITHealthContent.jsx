                                Most health plans know something is wrong with their IT environment — but they can't pinpoint exactly what. Projects are late. Security risks are unclear. Costs seem disconnected from value. The board wants answers, and the IT team is either too close to the problem or doesn't have the bandwidth to conduct an honest, comprehensive assessment.
