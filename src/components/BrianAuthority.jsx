                                Brian Damiani is not a generalist consultant who learned healthcare from a textbook. He is a <strong className="text-white">healthcare CIO</strong> who has lived inside payer organizations — managing complex IT environments, navigating core platform migrations, building cybersecurity programs, and leading cross-functional teams through some of the most challenging technology transformations in the health plan industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His career spans roles as a <strong className="text-white">health plan CIO</strong>, VP of Information Technology, and senior technology executive across multiple payer organizations. He has been the executive in the room when boards ask hard questions about IT risk, when CEOs need clarity on technology spending, and when health plans face critical vendor decisions that will shape their operations for years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This depth of <strong className="text-white">payer technology strategy</strong> experience is what sets Wendigo Advisors apart from traditional IT consulting firms. Brian doesn't need months to understand your environment — he's already operated in environments just like yours. From claims processing platforms to member experience portals, from HIPAA compliance to cloud migration strategy, his expertise is rooted in the real-world challenges that health plan IT leaders face every day.
