            question: "What is the CIO Operating System™?",
            answer: "It is a proprietary CIO operating model for healthcare designed to transform IT from a 'black box' into a strategic, governed business function. It focuses on Visibility, Governance, Security, and Strategic Alignment specifically for health plans and payer organizations."
          },
          {
            question: "How long does implementation take?",
            answer: "The initial assessment and roadmap (CIO360 IT Health Check) takes 2-3 weeks. Full operating model implementation typically rolls out over 3-6 months depending on organization size and complexity."
          },
          {
            question: "Is this software or consulting?",
            answer: "It is a strategic operating model (consulting framework) that may leverage your existing software tools to create better visibility, governance, and reporting dashboards. It is not a software product you install."
          },
          {
            question: "Do we need a CIO to implement this operating model?",
            answer: "No. The CIO Operating System™ can be implemented through our CIO as a Service model, where Brian Damiani serves as your fractional CIO during and after implementation. It also works alongside an existing internal CIO."
          },
          {
            question: "What size health plans benefit from a CIO operating model?",
            answer: "Health plans of all sizes benefit from structured IT governance. Small to mid-market plans (50,000-500,000 members) see the most dramatic improvements because they often lack formal IT governance structures entirely."
